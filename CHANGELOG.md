# Changelog

All notable changes to the Magnetic Agnostic Structure (MAS) specification are
documented in this file. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Versioning rules for MAS:

- **MAJOR** — backwards-incompatible schema changes (removed/renamed fields,
  tightened constraints, semantic changes to existing fields).
- **MINOR** — backwards-compatible additions (new optional fields, new schemas,
  new enum values that consumers are required to ignore-on-unknown).
- **PATCH** — clarifications, documentation, examples, bug fixes that do not
  alter the validation surface.

A change to the bundled component database (`data/*.ndjson`) follows the same
rules: adding a material/shape/wire is MINOR, removing or renaming one is
MAJOR.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **`resistivity` is no longer required on a core material.** It stays a defined,
  documented property and every existing record keeps it; it is simply no longer
  in the `required` list of `schemas/magnetic/core/material.json`.

  Rationale (ABT #1039). Two facts made the requirement untenable. First, the
  field is inert for the loss model most EMI-suppression ferrites use: in MKF,
  core-material resistivity is read only by `CoreLossesRoshenModel`'s
  eddy-current term and by `CoreMaterialCrossReferencer`'s similarity scoring,
  never by the `lossFactor` path. Second, it cannot be estimated when a maker
  does not publish it. Across NiZn grades at one permeability (mu_i 800-850) the
  filed and published values span **five decades** — Ferroxcube 4A11 1e2 ohm-m,
  Ferronics J 1e3, Meiwa J / ACME F80 / ACME M80 1e6, Fair-Rite 43 / Shinn Der
  N4S / Encore N1 1e7 — because resistivity is set by Fe(II) content and
  sintering, not by permeability. Requiring it therefore forced a fabricated
  value, of the one property the material's own loss model would not read.

  This unblocks real, shipping grades whose makers publish permeability,
  saturation and a loss curve but no resistivity.

  **Consumers of the generated bindings must regenerate and adapt.** The
  quicktype type changes from `std::vector<ResistivityPoint>` to
  `std::optional<std::vector<ResistivityPoint>>`, so call sites break at compile
  time rather than silently. In MKF there are THREE, found by compiling rather
  than by grepping — an early grep of mine was truncated and reported two:

  - `ResistivityCoreMaterialModel::get_resistivity` — throw `MISSING_DATA` on a
    disengaged optional, as it already does on empty data. No fallback.
  - `CoreMaterialCrossReferencer::MagneticCoreFilterResistivity` — mirror the
    Curie-temperature filter: no reference value skips the dimension, a candidate
    without one is culled from that filter. Nothing substituted.
  - `StrayCapacitance::core_image_factor` — the conduction-only branch is an
    `else if`, so a material without resistivity falls through to the no-data case
    already documented below it. Guard the optional, nothing else to decide.

  Verified end to end on a clean `origin/main` worktree with this schema and those
  three patches: MKF builds with 0 errors, and the catalogue plus one
  resistivity-less material parses as 1079 records, 1078 with resistivity and 1
  without. The same catalogue on the unpatched engine is rejected outright.

  Until a consumer regenerates, it will REJECT a record that omits the field —
  `nlohmann::json` raises `[json.exception.out_of_range.403] key 'resistivity'
  not found` and, in MKF's case, the whole `load_core_materials` call fails, not
  just that record. Land the regeneration before writing any record that omits it.

### Added

- **Optional `permittivity` on core materials.** Adds a `permittivity` object to
  the core material schema with a `complex` part (ε′ + j·ε″, same sign
  convention as complex permeability — the imaginary part is a positive loss
  magnitude), mirroring the `complex` entry under `permeability`: a `real` and
  an `imaginary` sub-object, each a new `permittivityPoint` (value, plus
  optional temperature and frequency). Enables modelling of dimensional
  effects (dimensional resonance) and displacement current in high-permittivity
  ferrites, and the effective usable bandwidth of a given core size. Non-breaking:
  the field is optional and existing materials are unaffected.
- **Complex permittivity data for 7 MnZn power ferrites** — ML91S, ML95S, ML27D
  (JFE), DMR51W, DMR96A (DMEGC), P63 (ACME) and 3F36 (Ferroxcube). ε'(f) and
  ε''(f) over 0.1–10 MHz, digitized from Fig. 23 of A. Nabih, F. Jin,
  R. Gadelrab and F. C. Lee, "Characterization and Mitigation of Dimensional
  Effects on Core Loss in High-Power High-Frequency Converters," IEEE Trans.
  Power Electron., 2023, doi: 10.1109/TPEL.2023.3285633
  (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149511). Values are read-offs from
  log–log figures — expect ~5–10 % uncertainty.

### Breaking

- **Removed `masVersion` and `masConformance` top-level fields.** MAS documents
  are the polymorphic payload of the shared PEAS container, and the PEAS root
  object was closed (`additionalProperties: false`) to reject junk keys. Rather
  than carve MAS-specific metadata into the shared root, both fields were removed.
- **Retired the conformance-classes feature (RFC 0002).** With `masConformance`
  gone, the Class A/B/C bundles (`schemas/conformance/`), their validator
  (`scripts/validate-conformance.py`), the test vectors (`tests/conformance/`)
  and `docs/conformance.md` were removed. RFC 0002 is marked Withdrawn.
- **Removed `inputs.converterInformation`** (unused; the topology seed files
  under `inputs/topologies/` remain for future use).
- **`TMFD` (μi=14) replaced by `TMFD 60` / `TMFD 90` (data, ABT #185).** TDG's
  own material workbook shows TMFD is an Fe-Si powder series in 60μ/90μ only —
  the two "duplicate" DC-bias fits were the per-grade coefficients (60μ:
  b=7.8e-7/c=1.70; 90μ: b=2.95e-7/c=2.23), and the μi=14 single record was a
  botched merge of them. No cores referenced `TMFD`. The per-grade fits
  reproduce TDG's published 82% μe@100 Oe (60μ) and the series loss
  coefficients reproduce the published 450 kW/m³ @ 50 kHz/100 mT.
- **Generic `Metglas` / `Finemet` records renamed to their actual alloy grades
  (data, ABT #221).** Each was a single record flattening a whole alloy family.
  Migration map for consumers that referenced a material by these bare names:
  `Metglas` → `Metglas 2605SA1` (Fe-based amorphous, the workhorse; Tc 395 °C
  matches 2605SA1), `Finemet` → `FT-3M` (FeCuNbSiB nanocrystalline; Bs 1.23 T /
  Tc 570 °C match FT-3M). The fitted μ(T) and loss curves are unchanged, only
  re-attributed. No cores or examples in MAS referenced the old bare names.
  Additional grades (Metglas 2605S3A/2605HB1M/2714A, Finemet FT-3K50T, …) are
  added separately (MINOR).

Note: `scripts/migrate-to-1.0.py` still writes `masVersion` and is now obsolete.

### Added

- **`cableCore` datasheet electrical subtype (new `oneOf` branch on `magnetic.manufacturerInfo.datasheetInfo.electrical[]`)** —
  clamp-on / cable ferrite cores (clip-on ferrites, cable rings, split/snap-on
  suppressors): a 1-port common-mode suppression core the cable is threaded
  through. Electrically a 1-port impedance like `chipBead`, but a distinct part
  class — retrofit/threaded onto a cable rather than reflow-soldered — so a
  consumer can query and prefer real cable cores for cable-level CM mitigation
  instead of overloading `chipBead`. Carries `impedancePoints` (with the
  existing per-point `current` for the DC-bias-derating curve), `numberTurns`,
  `dcResistance`, `ratedCurrents`/`ratedCurrentPoints`, `impedanceTolerance`,
  `selfResonantFrequency`, `mountingForm` (solidRing / snapOn / split /
  screwable — retrofit clamp vs build-time ring) and `maximumCableOuterDiameter`
  (the inner-diameter cable-fit limit, a primary cable-core selection param).
  Multi-turn curves reuse the existing
  one-electrical-entry-per-configuration idiom (a datasheet's 1/2/3-turn |Z|
  tables become one entry each, discriminated by `numberTurns`), and the
  toroid/ring geometry (inner/outer diameter, height) and ferrite material stay
  in the shared core description — no geometry or material fields are duplicated
  into the electrical block. Purely additive: every existing part still matches
  exactly one `oneOf` branch (verified against a per-subtype sample of the
  bundled catalog), and unknown-subtype-ignoring consumers are unaffected.
  Motivation: Hertz's radiated cable-mitigation picker currently selects from
  `chipBead` SMD beads for want of a cable-core class; this gives clamp-on cores
  a first-class home once the parts are ingested.
- **`saturationCurrentPeak` on the `commonModeChoke` electrical variant (ABT #279)** —
  peak core-saturating bias current in Amperes for current-compensated CMCs, mirroring
  the inductor variant's field. Motivation: 427 catalogued CMCs (WE-CMB/WE-LF/WE-CMBNC
  among others) carry a datasheet I_sat that previously had no schema slot, blocking
  their retag from the mistagged `inductor` variant.
- **Magnetics (Mag Inc.) power ferrites (data, ABT #213): L, R, P, F, T** — first
  Magnetics ferrite materials in the DB (their powder cores were already covered).
  Constants from the 2021 ferrite catalog (μi, Bs@1194 A/m 25 °C, Br, Tc, ρ,
  density, cross-checked against the parts database); loss model = Magnetics'
  official per-range equations `P[W/m³] = a·f^x·B^y·(b−cT+dT²)` mapped verbatim
  onto Steinmetz ranges (R/F/T reproduce the catalog's typical-loss table to ±3%);
  the catalog typical points are stored in `advanced_core_materials`. Known
  caveats: P's official equation overpredicts ~3× at 100 kHz vs the (internally
  inconsistent) typical table — kept official, discrepancy tracked in ABT #213;
  saturation has only the 25 °C point (Magnetics publishes no tabular 100 °C Bs);
  J/W/M/C/E/V (high-perm/filter grades) still pending loss-factor data.
- **6 more TDG MnZn ferrites (data): TPF26, TPW23, TP5H, TP5-B, TP5R, TP6** —
  measured μi–T curves and Pcv points from TDG's material-performance workbook
  with house-pipeline Steinmetz fits (13–31% mean error; TP6 split into
  [1,3 MHz]+[3 MHz,1 GHz] ranges). These grades have **no public datasheet**;
  Bs/Tc/resistivity/density are anchored on the closest documented family grade
  (TPF26←TP4A, TPW23←TPW30, TP5H/TP6←TP5E, TP5-B/TP5R←TP5) and must be replaced
  when TDG characteristic sheets arrive (ABT #196).
- **5 TDG MnZn ferrites (data): TP4, TPW33, TPG33B, TPB16, TPB22** — built from
  TDG's measured material-performance workbook (μi–T curves as the initial
  permeability, manufacturer Pcv points) plus per-material datasheet constants
  (Bs/Br/Hc/Tc/ρ/density; TPG33B constants from the 2025-11 automotive brochure,
  ρ/density carried from the TPG33 base grade). TPW33/TPG33B get house-pipeline
  Steinmetz fits (6.2% / 3.4% mean error, points in `advanced_core_materials`);
  TP4/TPB16/TPB22 carry their measured Pcv points inline (single (f,B) sweeps —
  a Steinmetz fit is not identifiable from them).
- **TP4A initial permeability upgraded** from the single spec point (2400 @ 25 °C)
  to the measured 24-point μi–T curve; TP4A/TP5 gained their measured Pcv–T
  sweeps in `advanced_core_materials`.
- **`frequencyFactor` on `pocoPermeabilityMethodData`** (optional `{a, b, c, d}`):
  percent-of-initial logistic rolloff `(a / (1 + (f/b)^c) + d) * 0.01`, matching
  the implementation MKF ships since ABT #169. Legalizes the 48 POCO V2026
  records that already carried the fitted factors.

### Fixed

- **Non-physical Steinmetz ranges refitted (data, ABT #183):** 12 ranges that
  validated but were physically garbage (β≈0: DMR28/DMR50B/DMR52/DMR51W/DN15P/JNP95;
  α≈0: ACME P47/P5; overfits: SMP53/DMR51/PC200) refitted with the house pipeline
  on manufacturer points from `advanced_core_materials`, normalized to `ct(25°C)=1`
  and gated (α∈[0.5,3.5], β≥1). Two unsupportable extrapolation ranges (DMR51W
  `[1,500k]`, P47 `[1M,1G]`) were deleted — MKF falls back to the neighbouring
  healthy range. DMR51's refit (α=3.59) exceeds the α-gate by 0.09 as a documented
  exception: the steepness is catalog-consistent (136 kW/m³ @ 3 MHz/10 mT/100 °C vs
  DMEGC's ≤150 spec). P5 is now temperature-flat (its only temperature-varying
  points were bogus, see below).
- **JNP95 (data):** the B=150 mT and B=300 mT loss series in
  `advanced_core_materials` were 1000× too small (kW/m³ digitized as W/m³).
- **P5 (data):** removed the 18 f=700 Hz loss points — three conflicting values per
  (f,B,T) and ~10⁵ W/m³ at 700 Hz/200 mT is impossible (frequency labels were lost
  in digitization).
- **`validate-db.py`:** merge-validates `massLosses` like `volumetricLosses` and
  flags losses blocks without a non-empty `default` method list (mirrors the MKF
  loader contract, ABT #184).
- **Metglas, AF, AN (data):** manufacturer loss curves were W/kg values stored as
  `volumetricLosses` (W/m³) — moved to `massLosses` (Nanoperm precedent), and the
  Steinmetz fits made on those W/kg points rescaled `k × density` into true W/m³.
- **Duplicate records (data):** 58 duplicated advanced lines removed (Kool Mµ /
  XFlux / High Flux / Edge / FS / MS / HF families; kept the last of each name,
  which is what MKF's last-wins merge already used); duplicate `XFlux 125`
  (2023 fit superseded by the 2025-08 refit) and `TMFD` base lines removed.
- **Nanoperm ×7 (data):** empty `volumetricLosses: {}` shells removed (undefined
  behavior in MKF's C++ advanced-materials merge).
- **M34 (data):** `datasheetUrl` pointed at M33's download path with the filename
  swapped; now the real TDK M34 datasheet URL.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-27

The breaking-changes release. Verified end-to-end against MKF
(`libMKF.so` and `MKF_tests` link clean against the regenerated
`MAS.hpp` with no source changes required in MKF beyond the
`mas_compat::parse` swap-in for old-document loading).

### Breaking

- **Enum casing sweep (RFC 0007).** Eight competing conventions
  collapsed to camelCase throughout, with explicit acronym
  (`AC`, `DC`, `SPS`, `EPS`, `DPS`, `TPS`, `SEPIC`) and IEC
  standard-code (`Y`/`A`/`E`/`B`/`F`/`H`/`N`/`R`/`200`/`220`/`250`,
  `MnZn`/`NiZn`/`FeSiAl`/etc.) exceptions.
- **IEC 60664 alignment (RFC 0008).** `pollutionDegree` `P1`/`P2`/`P3`
  → `PD1`/`PD2`/`PD3` plus a new `PD4`. `overvoltageCategory`
  `OVC-I`/`OVC-II`/`OVC-III`/`OVC-IV` → `I`/`II`/`III`/`IV`.
- **`magneticManufacturerInfo.cost`** unified with
  `distributorInfo.cost` to the structured `{value, currency}` form
  introduced in 0.2.0.

### Compatibility shim

- New `include/mas_compat.hpp` (header-only). Drop into any C++
  consumer alongside `MAS.hpp` and call `mas_compat::parse(s)`
  instead of `nlohmann::json::parse(s)` to keep loading pre-1.0
  documents transparently. Old enum spellings are rewritten in place
  before deserialization, so MKF / PyMKF / WebLibMKF / MVB++ continue
  to accept files written by 0.x tools.
- Migration tool `scripts/migrate-to-1.0.py` rewrites a MAS document
  (or directory tree) in place to the 1.0 spellings. Single source of
  truth for the mapping; mirrored in `mas_compat.hpp`.

### Schema work that landed and was kept

- **Loss-method `customCoreLossesMethodData` (open registry)** —
  drafted in step 2a, reverted at the end because it caused
  quicktype to rename `CoreLossesMethodData` and break the variant
  shape MKF depends on. Re-implementation needs either a
  quicktype-side workaround or coordinated MKF source updates;
  deferred to a post-1.0 RFC.
- **RFC 0006 topology operating-point dedup** — drafted in step 2,
  reverted in step 3 for the same reason: the allOf-with-
  baseOperatingPoint pattern made quicktype rename
  `OperatingPoint` to be the topology base type, with cascading
  consequences. Re-implementation needs a quicktype workaround;
  RFC stays Draft.

### Schema work landed (additive, kept)

- `impedanceAtFrequency` consolidated into `utils.json` (RFC 0006
  partial), used by `designRequirements.minimumImpedance`, common-
  mode choke and differential-mode choke. The bare-magnitude form
  was reverted to a pure `impedancePoint` reference to keep
  MKF source compatible.
- New optional `numberStrands` and `twistPitch` on `wire/litz.json`
  (closes the litz-construction gap noted in
  `docs/normative-references.md`).
- `tests/conformance/class-{A,B,C}/` populated with 8 vectors
  carrying `masConformance` declarations.
- Three CI scripts: `scripts/validate-samples.py`,
  `scripts/check-mas-hpp.sh`, `scripts/validate-conformance.py`.
- Bundled `data/*.ndjson` migrated to the new enum spellings.
- Tracked `MAS.hpp` regenerated and is now in sync with the schema.

### Out of scope

- RFC 0001 v2 prose sweep (per-field `description` rewriting to
  point at `docs/units.md`) deferred — cosmetic only, ship later.
- Loss-method open registry RFC and topology operating-point dedup
  RFC remain Draft; both blocked on quicktype-naming work.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-26

Standards-alignment release. Five RFCs implemented; license, governance
and normative references in place; project documentation reframed
around an open specification with a reference implementation.

All changes in 0.2.0 are **non-breaking**: every document that validated
against 0.1.0 continues to validate against 0.2.0. MKF rebuilds clean
against the new schema (verified end-to-end on this branch — 164/164
build steps, zero source changes required in MKF).

### Project / governance

- Apache-2.0 license (replaces BSD-4-Clause).
- New top-level docs: `CHANGELOG.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `MAINTAINERS.md`, `SECURITY.md`.
- `README.md` rewritten with a status table, scope, normative
  references, governance trail and history.
- Stewardship roadmap documented: OpenMagnetics → proposed PSMA
  Magnetics Committee Working Group.

### Specification framing

- New `docs/units.md` — normative SI units table (RFC 0001 v2). Bare
  numbers in JSON; one canonical unit per field, fixed by the spec.
- New `docs/normative-references.md` — comprehensive mapping of MAS
  fields to existing standards (IEC 62317, 63093, 60401, 60205, 60317,
  60228, 60085, 60112, 60664, 62368-1, 61558, 60050-151/-221, 60404,
  61007, 62044; ASTM A772/A773/A977/A1086/A753/A901; MPIF Standard 35;
  JIS C 2560/2565/2552/2550-1; NEMA MW 1000; SAE AMS 7717/7718/7701;
  MIL-PRF-27G; UL 1446; IEEE Std 393). Verbatim IEV definitions for
  turn (151-13-14), coil (151-13-15), winding (151-13-17), bifilar
  winding (151-13-18), air gap (221-04-13), magnetic core (221-04-24),
  laminated/powder/strip-wound core (221-04-25/26/27), yoke (221-04-32).
- New `docs/conformance.md` — defines Class A / B / C with their
  respective required fields and intended use cases.
- All schema descriptions reworded for IEV vocabulary alignment;
  citations to IEC 60401-3 (initial permeability convention),
  IEC 60085 (insulation thermal classes), IEV 103-02 (values of a
  periodic quantity).

### Added (schema)

- `masVersion` (optional, root) — SemVer string; will become required
  at 1.0.
- `masConformance` (optional, root) — `"A"` / `"B"` / `"C"`; declares
  which conformance class this document targets.
- New `schemas/conformance/{class-A,class-B,class-C}.json` bundles
  that `allOf`-extend `MAS.json` with class-specific tightening.
- New shared `cost` type `{value: number, currency: ISO 4217 code}`.
  `manufacturerInfo.cost` and `distributorInfo.cost` reference it.
- New shared `irdi` type (RFC 0003) with ISO/IEC 11179-6 pattern.
  Optional `irdi` field on `manufacturerInfo`, available on every
  catalogue record (cores, materials, wires, bobbins, insulation).
- `outputVoltagesType` and `outputCurrentsType` on `baseOperatingPoint`
  — optional discriminator over `dc / rms / peak / peakToPeak / average`,
  default `dc`.
- New permeability slots (RFC 0005): `incremental` (μΔ) and
  `reversible` (μᵣₑᵥ) on `core/material.json` `permeability`. Required
  for inductors operating under DC bias.
- `surfaceResistivity` on `insulation/material.json` (Ω/sq per IEC 60093),
  alongside the existing volume resistivity.
- `measurementCondition` block on `outputs.magnetizingInductance` —
  optional `{frequency, voltageRms, currentRms, dcBiasCurrent, temperature}`
  pinning the operating point at which the inductance applies.
- `cylindrical` value on `coordinateSystem` (RFC 0009) — natural for
  toroidal cores; `(r, theta, z)`.
- IEC 60085 letter-class form on `insulation/material.json`
  `temperatureClass` — `oneOf [letter enum, °C number]`.
- New RFC stream under `proposals/` documenting design proposals 0001
  through 0009. Five Implemented, two Draft (1.0 batch), one
  Withdrawn, one Superseded.

### Changed (schema)

- `$id` swept from `http://openmagnetics.com/schemas/...` to
  `https://psma.com/mas/...` across all 44 schema files.
  Cross-`$ref` links unaffected (all relative).
- SPDX header `"$comment": "SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0"` added
  to every schema file.
- 10 inlined topology operating-point definitions (RFC 0006) refactored
  to `allOf [baseOperatingPoint, extras]`. Net diff: 85 insertions,
  580 deletions. Field shape unchanged for valid documents.
- `magnetic.json` `manufacturerInfo` re-defined as `allOf`-extension
  of the shared `utils.json` `manufacturerInfo` (eliminates the second,
  contradictory `cost: string` definition).
- `gap.coordinates` now `$ref`s the shared `coordinates` def instead
  of redefining it inline.
- Loss-method descriptions on `core/material.json` pinned to W/m³, Hz,
  T (peak); Steinmetz `k` units made explicit.
- Thermal resistance corrected from `W/K` to `K/W` in
  `operatingConditions.json` (heatsink, coldPlate). Same correction
  in `magnetic.json` `magneticDatasheetThermal` and
  `outputs.json` `bulkThermalResistance`.
- Saturation flux density description tightened to the IEC convention
  (10 % drop in differential permeability).
- Bobbin and coil prose rewritten to align with IEV 60050-151
  vocabulary (winding, turn, coil).
- `additionalProperties: false` added to leaf schemas (`resistivityPoint`,
  `bhCyclePoint`, `complexFieldPoint`, `fieldPoint`, `manufacturerInfo`,
  `distributorInfo`, `marginInfo`, `connection`, `partialWinding`, `cost`).
  Wave 2 (root containers) deferred pending a fixture audit.
- Various unit format fixes: `J/(kg*K)` instead of `J/Kg/K`,
  `W/(m*K)` instead of `W/m/K` (per ISO 80000); units added to
  previously bare-number outputs (`creepageDistance`, `clearance`,
  `withstandVoltage`, `withstandVoltageDuration`, core-loss outputs).
- Bobbin enum: removed duplicate `"er"` entry. Pure cleanup.

### Fixed

- Numerous prose typos: `losses → loses`, `thicknes → thickness` (×4),
  `whre → where`, `descriptionof → description of`,
  `impendance → impedance`, `dieletric → dielectric` (×5, including
  the `dieletricStrengthPoint` field rename), `tetha → theta`,
  `gamma → phi/z` (in coordinate-system prose), `Magnetic method →
  Magnetec method`. Removed unverifiable "IEEE 750181" citation.
- `EN 62317` references updated to the canonical `IEC 62317` (and
  forward-reference to `IEC 63093` for planar).
- `eddyCurrentCoreLosses` and `hysteresisCoreLosses` constraint
  relaxed from `>0` to `≥0` (low-conductivity ferrites can have eddy
  losses approaching zero).

### Deprecated

- BSD-4-Clause license. Removed in this release; downstream
  redistributors relying on the advertising clause should switch to
  Apache-2.0 attribution.

### Out of scope (deferred to 1.0)

- Per-field `description`-text sweep referencing `docs/units.md`
  (RFC 0001 v2 prose pass).
- Enum casing convention sweep (RFC 0007).
- `pollutionDegree` / `overvoltageCategory` rename to IEC 60664
  spelling (RFC 0008).
- Loss-method open registry (extension to current closed `anyOf`).
- Per-class test-vector partition under `tests/conformance/`.
