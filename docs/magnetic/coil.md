# Coil

> Vocabulary in this chapter is anchored to **IEV 60050-151** (turn,
> coil, winding, bifilar winding). Verbatim definitions are reproduced
> in [`../normative-references.md`](../normative-references.md) §6b.

Following the same principle as with the core, the coil is described
the way it is manufactured: wires are selected, prepared and wound onto
a bobbin (coil former) in a defined sequence. The bobbin is therefore
included in this section as part of the coil, which makes it possible
to describe a coil without committing to a specific core — only the
bobbin and the windings.

The terms used here align with industry practice. To avoid
misinterpretation they are defined explicitly below, with the IEV
reference number where one applies.

* Coil: This refers to the whole set of windings, 
* Winding: This refers to an individual winding when specifically indicated (e.g.: “primary winding”, “winding 1”)
* Partial Winding: A subset of an individual winding, either a proportion of its turns or a proportion of its parallels; a proportion of both is not supported, and in those rare cases the Turns Description must be used. It contains the following fields:
    * Name: Reference name given to the partial winding.
    * Winding: Reference to the winding where it belongs to.
    * Turns proportion: Number from 0 to 1 indicating the proportion of turns contained in this partial winding.
    * Parallel proportion: Number from 0 to 1 indicating the proportion of parallels contained in this partial winding.
* Winding window: This is the space available for placing the turns of any or all windings in a magnetic component. There is usually one per core, but certain kinds of bobbins offer many windows in order to help control the coupling, in which case more than one winding window will be available.
* Physical turn: Any physical turns wound around the bobbin, independent of its series or parallel connection. Current can circulate through it, generating losses and magnetic field.
* Turn: A turn from the magnetic point of view, in the sense that it is connected in series with others and generates inductance.
* Parallel: A physical turn that is connected in parallel with others, and all of them are considered as one from the magnetic point of view. Electrically it divides the current through the magnetic turn they belong to.
* Layer: A group of physical turns that are wound together, one after the other, in a vertical (e.g.: wound inductors) or horizontal (e.g.: planar inductors) fashion. The increment and positioning can be done in one dimension.
* Section: A group of layers (or only one layer) that belong to the same winding (e.g.: primary winding) or a group of similar windings (e.g.: two secondaries wound together in a Center-tapped Full Bridge). The number of sections and their relative placement defines the interleaving of the whole winding.
* Isolation side: Label that defines one individual winding or a group of windings that have a common ground. Windings with different labels imply that they are electrically isolated.

Additionally, four levels or descriptions are used, each one more detailed than the previous one. The reason for this is to provide the freedom to choose the necessary level of detail needed for a given application. A core losses model might only use the basic Functional Description, with the number of turns; a leakage inductance model might use a Section Description to study the interleaving; a temperature model or a Finite Element simulation might use a Layer Description to predict the temperature rise; and finally winding losses model or a automatic tool for creating assembly instructions might use the Turn Description to accurately predict the losses or generate the assembly steps.
## Name
This name references the whole winding and can be used to refer to it from any number of magnetic components. This field can contain any valid string of characters.
## Bobbin
As it was explained before, the bobbin is optionally included in this section, the winding, instead of the core, as it is the part where the wires are wound, allowing combining different cores for the same winding. 
If this is not present, the winding is described only as a 2D entity, and can only be fully described once the core has been chosen.
This field can be of two types, either a string containing the reference of the bobbin used, or the description of the bobbin itself. In the second case it contains the following fields:

* Name: Reference name for this bobbin.
* Type: The type of a bobbin. It can be either:
    * Standard
    * Custom
* Family: Family of core shape that this bobbin is compatible with
* Manufacturer Info: Dictionary/Map with the information about the manufacturer, including name, status of the material, internal reference, or cost.
* Shape: The name of a magnetic shape that this bobbin belongs to
* Family Subtype: The subtype of the shape this bobbin belongs to, in case there are more than one.
* Dimensions: The dimensions of a bobbin, keys must be as defined in EN 62317
* Pinout: The manufacturing specification of the former's pins (pitch, row distance, central pitch, number of rows and pins per row).
* Number Chambers: Number of winding chambers the former is divided into by interior dividers.
* Base: The mounting base of the bobbin, for toroid bases (family `t`).

### Multi-chamber (split) bobbins
A chambered former is a tube whose winding area is split by interior walls, one chamber per winding; the wall is the creepage barrier that lets the design skip margin tape on that interface, and the side-by-side geometry it creates is what sets the leakage inductance. The chambers themselves are already expressed as several entries of the processed description's `windingWindows` sharing the same `column` (see the winding-placement section below). Two optional fields describe the walls that make them. `numberChambers` (functional description, integer >= 1) is the count a catalogue row can state on its own; 1, which is also what absent means, is a plain two-flange former. `dividers` (processed description) is the geometry, one entry per interior wall in the order they appear along the column: `thickness` along the column axis, `coordinates` of the wall centre referred to the main column centre, an optional `height` giving its radial reach (absent means it reaches as far as the flanges), and an optional `crossingSlot` (`width` along the rim, `depth` radially inwards, `angle` in degrees from the positive x axis) for the notch a wire crosses through from one chamber to the next. A record that gives `numberChambers` without the divider geometry stays valid data; it is the winding model that fails loudly rather than invent a wall thickness. The IEC-style labels vendors print for the wall and the chamber widths (`w1`, `c1..cN`) go into the open `dimensions` map.

**Chamber labels in the `dimensions` map.** A record that transcribes the chamber geometry of an `N`-chamber former (`numberChambers: N`) carries all of the following, each a dimension with tolerance, in metres:

* `c1` .. `cN`: the width of each chamber, measured along the column axis between the faces that bound it (a flange face or a wall face).
* `w1` .. `w(N-1)`: the thickness of each interior wall, along the column axis; wall `wK` sits between chambers `cK` and `c(K+1)`.

Chambers and walls are numbered in column order starting from the positive end of the column axis (the top of the window in MKF's frame, where the first section of a window is placed). The stack `c1 + w1 + c2 + ... + cN` is the winding length between the two flange faces as the drawing states it, and a processor builds the chamber windows and the `dividers` from these labels alone. The labels describe walls that reach as far as the flanges, which is what an absent divider `height` means; a wall drawn shorter than the flanges needs its height stated and is not expressible with these labels. A record carrying `numberChambers > 1` without the full label set is valid data, and a processor must refuse to split its window rather than guess the walls. The records transcribed so far, and the rule used to read each drawing, are documented in `scripts/enrich-bobbin-chambers-norwe.py`.

**Pin rail labels in the `dimensions` map.** A vertical former carries its pins in plastic pin rails: one bar per pin row, moulded under the bottom flange's extension and reaching past the core, whose underside is the pin standoff the pins leave from. The IEC letters `a`, `b`, `c`, `H1`, `H2`, `D1`..`D3` already describe the outline (for the Miles-Platts PQ formers: `a` the rail length along the rows, outer end to outer end; `b` the outer rail edge of one row to the outer rail edge of the other; `c` the overall height from the pin standoff to the top of the core-retaining tabs on the top flange; `H1` flange outer face to flange outer face). Four further labels locate the rails, each a dimension with tolerance, in metres:

* `H3`: rail height, from the bottom flange's outer face down to the pin standoff (the rail underside), along the column axis.
* `H4`: tab height, from the top flange's outer face to the top of the core-retaining tabs, along the column axis, so that `c = H4 + H1 + H3`.
* `b1`: rail width across the row, from the rail's outer edge (the one `b` is measured to) inwards to the innermost edge of the rail outline in the top view.
* `a1`: the gap along the row between the two blocks a rail is split into, centred on the column axis; each block runs from `a1/2` to `a/2` on its side.

Picture the former standing on its pins, seen from the side along the rows: the column tube between the two flanges (`H1`), the tabs standing `H4` above the top flange, and under the bottom flange the rail blocks hanging `H3` down to the standoff; seen from above, each row is a bar `a` long and `b1` wide whose outer edge lies at `b/2` from the column axis, cut in the middle by a slot `a1` wide. Pin wrap notches and standoff ribs are not described by these labels. The values on the eight Miles-Platts PQ records (PQ0010..PQ0080) were measured at scale from the raster drawings the records link, and the rule used is listed in `scratch/abt1249-miles-platts-pq-pin-rails.csv`.

### Toroid bases
A wound toroid is mounted on a moulded base that holds the ring, sets its standoff from the board and owns its pins — so a base is described as a bobbin of family `t`: it plays the former's role and reuses `pinout`, `pins[]` and `connections[]` rather than introducing a second pin vocabulary. `base` (optional, on the functional description) carries `mounting` (`horizontal` lays the ring flat in a pocket, `vertical` stands it on edge in a boat), the overall `length`, `width` and `height`, and the `standoff` — the five fields every base datasheet prints, all of them dimensions with tolerance. A horizontal base adds `pocketInnerDiameter` and `pocketDepth`, a vertical one `boatWidth`, and both may state the selection limits `maximumCoreOuterDiameter` and `maximumCoreHeight`, the largest wound core the base accepts. The bobbin's existing `orientation` keeps its own meaning (how the former is mounted); `mounting` is the toroid's. See [MAS-RFC 0014](../../proposals/0014-bobbin-dividers-and-toroid-base.md).

## Functional Description
This level or description is intended to hold the minimum information that can describe the winding of a magnetic component, although only in simple cases completely. It is intended for applications with simple windings or where detailed information is not needed, as is the case of an inductance or core losses model.
The structure consists of a list of elements, where each element describes one individual winding (e.g.: primary, secondary, auxiliary). A simple inductor will have one element, a simple transformer two, and any extra winding for additional outputs will be additional elements in the list.
Each of these windings will contain the following fields:
* Name: Reference name of the winding (e.g.: primary).
* Isolation Side: Reference label for the isolation side, as defined previously.
* Number Parallels: Number of parallels in this winding, as defined previously.
* Number Turns: Number of turns in this winding, as defined previously.
* Wire: Wire used in this winding. As defined in the [Wire Section] (https://github.com/OpenMagnetics/MAS/blob/main/docs/magnetic/wire.md)

        }
    ]
}
```

    "name": "MyTransformer",
    "functionalDescription":[
        {
            "name": "Primary",

            "wire": "Solid Round 32AWG"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Sections Description
This level or description is an increment to the previous one, adding more detail to the Functional level. It describes the coil with a granularity of sections (as described above).

If we represented the winding window of the core as a 2D rectangle, we would see the cross section of the wires as circles or rectangles (depending on the type of the wire). If we grouped the physical turns that belong to the same winding and only that one with encircling rectangles, these rectangles would represent the sections of our designs. A simple inductor will have only one section, and non-interleaved simple transformer will have two sections, and a transformer with primary and secondary interleaved once will have four sections.

Each of these sections contains a part or the whole of the winding they belong to, and, together with the excitation, this level of detail is enough to calculate the leakage inductance with simple models, or the winding losses according to Dowell’s model.

It consists on a list of sections, each element containing the following fields:

* Name: Reference name of the section
* Layers Orientation: Way in which the layers are oriented inside the section. It can be one of the following:
    * Horizontal
    * Vertical
    * Radial
* Partial Windings: List of partial windings in this section
* Dimensions: Dimensions of the rectangle defining the section
* Coordinates: The coordinates of the center of the section, referred to the center of the main column of the core.


## Layers Description
As the previous case, this description is an incremental step to either the Functional or Section Description. Although it is still not enough to fully describe the whole coil, it has enough information for certain analytical models, like capacitance or temperature rise.

It breaks down each of the sections into layers, allowing defining them as insulation or wiring layers. For wiring layers it contains how many turns and parallels go into each one, for insulation layers, the material used. In both cases its dimension and coordinates must be specified.

It consists on a list of layer, each element containing the following fields:

* Name: Reference name of the layer.
* Type: Type of the layer. It can be either:
    * Wiring
    * Insulation
* Section (optional): Reference of the section this layer belongs to, if the Section Description exists.
* Orientation:  Way in which the layer is oriented. It can be one of the following:
    * Horizontal
    * Vertical
    * Radial
* Partial Windings: List of partial windings in this layer.
* Insulation Material: Insulation material used in the layer
* Dimensions: Dimensions of the rectangle defining the layer
* Coordinates: The coordinates of the center of the layer, referred to the center of the main column of the core.

## Turns Description
This is the deepest and most detailed level of description for the coil of a magnetic component. It consists of describing each of the physical turns existing in all the individual windings, including their exact position inside the winding window.

It is useful for advanced Finite Element Simulation or advanced analytical models, like 2D winding losses, where the proximity effect from each physical turn into all the others is taken into account.

It can be used together with all the previous Descriptions or just with the Functional one. It consists of a list of individual physical turns, each element containing the following fields:

* Name: Reference name of the physical turn.
* Winding: The winding reference where the physical turn belongs to.
* Parallel: The reference of the parallel that this physical turn belongs to, in case there is more than one.
* Layer (optional): The reference of the layer that this physical turn belongs to.
* Section: (optional): The reference of the section that this physical turn belongs to.
* Turns Alignment: Way in which the turns are aligned inside the layer. It can be one of the following:
    * Inner or top
    * Outer or bottom
    * Spread
    * Centered
* Orientation: Way in which the physical turn is wound, it can be either:
    * Clockwire 
    * Counter Clockwise
* Length (optional): The length of the physical turn, referred from the center of its cross section.
* Angle: The angle that the physical turn does, useful for partial turns.
* Coordinates: The coordinates of the center of the physical turn, referred to the center of the main column.

## Winding Placement (multiple winding windows and columns)
By default, every winding is placed in the first winding window (index 0), which wraps the main column of the core (the central column, or the first column for shapes without a central one, like U cores). This is the historical behavior and remains the default when no placement field is present, so all pre-existing MAS files keep their meaning.

For magnetics that place windings in more than one winding window — windings on the lateral legs of an E core, each leg of a U/UT core, split-bobbin chambers, or angular sectors of a toroid — the placement is declared explicitly with three optional fields, all of them indices into the `windingWindows` list of the governing bobbin (or core) processed description:

* `windingWindow` on a **winding** (functional description): the intent, used by auto-winders and advisers before any section exists.
* `windingWindow` on a **group**: where the sections of that group are placed. This realizes the original purpose of groups ("distinct winding windows or PCB sub-assemblies").
* `windingWindow` on a **section**: the finest override.

The effective winding window of a section resolves as: `section.windingWindow` if present, else its group's `windingWindow`, else the `windingWindow` of the winding of its first partial winding, else 0. Layers and turns inherit the placement of their section through their existing `section`/`layer` name references; they carry no placement field of their own.

Which physical column a window wraps is declared on the window itself: each winding window of the core (and bobbin) processed description may carry a `column` field, the index of the column (in the `columns` list) that turns placed in that window are wound around. If absent, the main column is assumed. This single edge disambiguates the two multi-window layouts that exist in practice:

* **Per-column windows** (windings on different legs): the windows carry *different* `column` values.
* **Stacked chambers** (split bobbins around one column): the windows carry the *same* `column` value and differ only in their coordinates.

Two consistency rules apply regardless of placement:

1. **Coordinates are always global.** The `coordinates` of groups, sections, layers and turns remain referred to the center of the main column of the core, whatever their assigned winding window. The placement fields are declarative labels; the coordinates stay the single geometric truth, and a valid coil has each element's coordinates contained in its assigned window.
2. **Fractions of a winding split across windows** are expressed with the existing `partialWindings` proportions: two sections (or groups) in different windows, each holding a proportion of the same winding, describe for example a common-mode choke with half the turns on each side, or a transformer with its primary split between the central and a lateral leg.

## Connections and pin assignment
Each winding of the functional description may carry a list of `connections`, one per terminated end: where the wire leaves the coil and what it is soldered to (`type`, `pinName`, `direction`, `length`, `diameter`, and the PCB terminal details of MAS-RFC 0012). Two optional fields say *which* end of the winding a connection is and *which* strand it belongs to.

`end` (optional, `start` | `finish` | `tap`) names the end of the winding that terminates on this terminal. `start` is the dot end, the first turn wound; `finish` is the last turn wound; `tap` is an intermediate junction, and a series junction between two sections appears as a `tap` connection on both of them with the same `pinName`. `direction` (`input`/`output`) is the *electrical* current direction and is not a substitute: winding houses differ on which pin of a pair is the start, so the build order has to be stated rather than inferred. `parallel` (optional, integer >= 0) is the index of the parallel strand that terminates on this terminal; when it is absent, every parallel of the winding terminates together on the same terminal, which is what a single solder joint of several strands means.

The pin the connection names lives on the bobbin (`bobbin.processedDescription.pins[]`, each with a `name`, a shape, a type and its coordinates relative to the main column centre). A pin may be marked `removable` (optional boolean, default `false`): bobbin makers publish formers whose corner pin is cut off or omitted in a variant to open up creepage, and an assignment algorithm is allowed to drop such a pin rather than fail. Absent means the pin is always there.

**The industry rule the default assignment follows** (normative for the reference implementation, informative for other consumers; stated in full in [MAS-RFC 0013](../../proposals/0013-pin-assignment.md)): *rows are isolation groups* — each `isolationSide` takes one pin row, or one contiguous block of pins where there are more sides than rows, and the sides needing the largest creepage between them are put on opposite rows; *start and finish are adjacent pins within that row*, the start nearest the flange where the first turn begins and the finish nearest the flange where the last layer ends; and *taps are shared* — the finish of section k and the start of section k+1 are the same pin, both marked `tap`. Parallels share a pin while the wraps physically fit it, otherwise they take adjacent pins and each connection carries its `parallel` index. No plan that meets the creepage requirement means a loud failure, never a silent fall-back.

**Default pin numbering.** Where a bobbin's own datasheet does not name its pins, MAS numbers them **counter-clockwise starting from row 0**, seen from the mounting side (owner decision, 2026-09-12), pin 1 being the first pin of row 0. This is only a default for generated pin names: a bobbin record that carries its manufacturer's own pin names keeps them, and those names are what `pinName` must match.

## Lead sleeving
A lead leaves the winding, crosses the margin band and runs along the flange to its terminal with nothing but its enamel, which is not insulation in the safety sense, so winding shops slide a sleeve over it. `sleeve` (optional, on a connection) records that sleeve: `material` (the insulation material record or the name of one, which is where its dielectric strength, temperature class and permittivity come from), `wallThickness` (the distance through insulation the sleeve provides) and `innerDiameter` (its fit over the lead) are required, because those three are what makes a sleeve a sleeve and what decides whether the sleeved outer diameter still fits the margin and the terminal's bend radius. `overlapIntoWinding` (optional) is how far the sleeve reaches back over the wound part past the point where the lead leaves it — the practice construction sheets state as a couple of millimetres past the margin's inner edge, recorded rather than assumed — and `numberLayers` (optional, default 1) covers the doubled or tripled sleeve used for reinforced insulation. Absent means a bare lead, which is what every document described before the field existed. The material a sleeve is cut from is identified in the insulation-material database by its `form` (`tape`, `film`, `sleeve`, `varnish`), and its `cti` is the tracking index IEC 60664-1 turns into a required creepage distance. See [MAS-RFC 0016](../../proposals/0016-lead-sleeving.md).
