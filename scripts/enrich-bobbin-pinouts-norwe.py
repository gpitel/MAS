"""Enrich ``data/bobbins.ndjson`` pin geometry from Norwe's OWN dimensioned drawings.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The interchange pass (``scripts/enrich-bobbin-pinouts.py``, ABT #1171) could speak for a
Norwe record only where two other moulders' parametric tables agreed on the same standard
footprint; 255 of the 393 Norwe records were left with a pin COUNT and nothing else.  Those
records already carry the first-party evidence in ``manufacturerInfo.datasheetUrl``: a Norwe
catalogue sheet at ``norwe.eu/katalogbilder/*.pdf``, which draws the part's own pin field.

WHAT THE SHEET ACTUALLY STATES
------------------------------
Every sheet carries a "Grid / View pin-side" panel: the pin field seen from the solder side,
drawn as filled dots on a ruled grid whose pitch the panel dimensions (2.54 mm, 2.5 mm, ...).
That panel is a measurement, not a table lookup - so the numbers below are read off the one
drawing that belongs to the record being written, and nothing is carried across parts.

Both readings are geometric and are taken from the PDF's vector content, never from a
rendered image or from OCR:

* the dot centres give the pin field: how many parallel rows, how many pins in each, and the
  spacings along and across the rows, exactly, in points;
* the scale comes from the panel's own dimension.  Where the panel is ruled, one grid step is
  the unit and every dot must sit on a whole number of steps - a dot that does not is a
  reading this script refuses to make.  Where it is not ruled, the panel's single dimension
  fixes the scale only if, at that scale, EVERY measured distance lands within 1 % of a
  dimension printed elsewhere on the same sheet; anything less is ambiguity, and ambiguity is
  refused rather than rounded into place.

WHAT IS NOT WRITTEN
-------------------
* ``pinDescription`` - Norwe identifies a pin by a type code ("Solder-pin: z112/ua"), not by
  a diameter or a length, so the sheet does not state one and this script never invents one.
* anything at all when the dot count disagrees with the record's ``numberPins``, when the
  sheet draws more than two rows (several footprint variants share one sheet), when the pin
  gaps in a row are irregular in a way ``pitch``/``centralPitch`` cannot express, or when the
  drawing is unreachable.  Every refusal is one row of the report CSV with its reason.
* any change to a record that already carries geometry.  Where such a record's own Norwe
  drawing disagrees with what is stored, the record is left exactly as it is and the
  disagreement is reported as a conflict for a human to settle - this script does not get to
  overrule an earlier source on its own.

``rowDistance`` is written as the FULL row-to-row distance, which is what the 78 records of
ABT #1171 already hold and what MKF consumes (it places the rows at +/- rowDistance/2).
