"""Loss-model sanity checker for MAS core_materials.

Evaluates every material's *volumetric* loss model at a grid of reference operating
points (sinusoidal excitation) and flags physically-implausible results — the class of
bugs that unit/scale errors in an import produce (e.g. a lossFactor stored 1e6x too
large, a Steinmetz `k` off by a decade, a coefficient copied from the wrong family).

It is a Python mirror of MKF's CoreLosses formulas (physical_models/CoreLosses.cpp):
  steinmetz   P = k·f^alpha·B^beta·(ct2·T^2 - ct1·T + ct0)   [range-selected by f; ct only if >0]
  magnetics   P = a·B^b·f^c
  poco        P = 1000·(a·(f/1000)·(B·10)^b + c·(B·10·f/1000)^2)
  tdg         P = 1000·(B·10)^a·(b·(f/1000) + c·(f/1000)^d)
  micrometals P = f/(a/B^3 + b/B^2.3 + c/B^1.65) + d·B^2·f^2
  (roshen: resistivity/permeability based — not evaluated here; lossFactor: factor range
   is checked instead of a full loss evaluation.)

Units: P in W/m^3, f in Hz, B in T (peak), T in Celsius.

Checks (HARD = non-zero exit, physics violations; SOFT = warning, eyeball-worthy):
  HARD  loss non-finite or <= 0 at any reference point
  HARD  loss not strictly increasing with B (at fixed f,T)
  HARD  loss not strictly increasing with f (at fixed B,T)
  HARD  steinmetz alpha/beta outside the physical band (import/fit blunder)
  HARD  saturation flux density RISES with temperature (Bs falls toward the Curie point)
  HARD  steinmetz ct(T) <= 0 anywhere in the OPERATING band (OPERATING_TSPAN): MKF drops the
        temperature scaling there, so the model has no temperature dependence where it is used
  SOFT  reference loss (100 kHz, 100 mT, 100 C) outside [PLAUS_LO, PLAUS_HI] kW/m^3
  SOFT  reference loss > OUTLIER_RATIO x its material-family median (per-family scale error)
  SOFT  steinmetz ct(T) <= 0 only OUTSIDE the operating band (fit runs out at the extremes)
  SOFT  steinmetz alpha/beta outside the typical band
  SOFT  Bs above the material-class ceiling / Curie temp below a characterization temp
  SOFT  lossFactor drops with rising frequency (loss factor normally increases)
  HARD  lossFactor factor value outside [LF_LO, LF_HI]  (tan-delta/mu_i is ~1e-6..1e-1)

Materials whose steinmetz ranges do not cover REF_F are NOT evaluated at the reference point and
take no part in the plausibility / family-median comparisons: MKF's range selection extrapolates
to the nearest range end, so a grade fitted at 1-3 MHz would otherwise be judged on a number
invented two decades below its data. They are counted and listed under --verbose.

Usage:  python3 scripts/check-loss-sanity.py [--verbose] [--baseline]
        --verbose   list the reference loss of every material
        --baseline  print a stable name,loss CSV (regression baseline)
Exit code 0 if no HARD failures, 1 otherwise.
